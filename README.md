# VaultifyChain

> **Secure storage meets verifiable proof on blockchain**

VaultifyChain is the world's first blockchain-verified file storage platform that combines end-to-end encryption with immutable audit trails. Built for enterprises, legal firms, healthcare organizations, and research institutions that require both security and verifiable proof of data integrity.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔐 End-to-End Encryption**: AES-256 encryption applied locally before upload
- **⛓️ Blockchain Verification**: Every file action recorded on BlockDAG for immutable proof
- **👥 Controlled Access**: Wallet-based access control with granular permissions
- **📊 Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into file access and modifications
- **🌐 Decentralized Storage**: Files stored on IPFS for redundancy and censorship resistance
- **🔍 Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic proof that files haven't been tampered with
